First... _What is NMAP?_

> nmap (Network Mapper) is a security scanner originally written by Gordon Lyon (also known by his pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich)[1] used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network. To accomplish its goal, Nmap sends specially crafted packets to the target host and then analyzes the responses. Most places if worked, for some reason, don't use Nmap as much as you would think. Occasionally I'll have someone walk over and ask me if I know something about an IP (what OS, what application, etc), I'll ask what they've done so far, and typically the reply is something along the line of "I ran a ping and tried to get the hostname". Well weather or not the ping was successful, it wont tell you much, and unless theres a very specific hostname convention, and a PTR record for that IP, you still won't get much.  One of Nmaps most famous features is OS Guessing, what it does is scans the targets open ports, and looks through an [OS Detection Database](https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/nmap-os-db), then spits back the ports/protocols, and which OS's it think may be on the device.  Now if you work in the network, you would know right away if it's just a Linux server, Oracle appliance, MySQL server, Firewall, F5... etc etc.  The following examples are me running NMAP from my local Macbook Pro against my personal [www.justinhyland.com](http://www.justinhyland.com "www.justinhyland.com") hosted server, so don't expect to find anything special.  The three flags you will almost always want to use are
- **-v** - Verbose
- **-O** - OS GUess
- **-Pn** - Skip the ping step (incase the target has ICMP disabled)
 So let's start with a simple Nmap query using the flags listed above...

    $ sudo nmap -v -Pn -O 23.227.177.25

    PORT STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp open ssh
    25/tcp filtered smtp
    80/tcp open http

    139/tcp filtered netbios-ssn
    445/tcp filtered microsoft-ds
    3322/tcp open active-net
    8090/tcp open unknown
    Device type: general purpose
    Running: Linux 3.X
    OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:3
    OS details: Linux 3.1 - 3.4
    Uptime guess: 27.680 days (since Thu Jan 23 07:13:26 2014)
    Network Distance: 14 hops
    TCP Sequence Prediction: Difficulty=260 (Good luck!)
    IP ID Sequence Generation: All zeros

 So from the above Nmap result, you can pretty much immediately tell its a Linux server, with some abnormal ports open (8090, 3322), as well as a good guess of what application is running on those ports. It also gives you a pretty accurate OS guess. Heres the output of uname from the target server itself

    # # uname -r -o
    2.6.32-042stab084.12 GNU/Linux

 So it got the kernel version pretty close _(Linux 2.6.19 - 2.6.35)_, and it got the OS correct _(Linux)_
* * *
  Lets add some more useful flags..
- **--allports** - Don't exclude any ports from version detection
- **--reason** - Host and port state reasons
- **-n** - Never do DNS resolution (Also makes it quicker)
- **-sV** - Probe open ports to determine service/version info

    $ sudo nmap -v -Pn -n -sV --allports -O --reason 23.227.177.25

 Granted, all of this information is nothing more than openly accessible information from the system, it sure tells you a lot more than you would be able to find out on your own.  You can also use Nmap to scan entire subnets, to find any hosts that you don't know are on your network. Or say you just plugged in a new device, cant login to it, your router hasn't cached the network layout yet, you could use nmap to simply scan the subnet. The example command is.. [bash]sudo nmap -sS -O 192.168.1.1/24[/bash]  Another feature of Nmap that I like a lot is the _-oX filename.xml_ flag, which outputs all of the information into XML format in the filename filename.xml. This is very useful if you plan to script against your results. Much more useful than just using _grep_, _awk_ or _sed_ against the output.  Thats it! Now before you run to someone else about a system you have no idea about, use **Nmap**!
